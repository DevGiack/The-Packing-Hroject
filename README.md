# The Hacking Project NFT Collection

The Hacking Project NFT Collection is a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on the popular web development course, The Hacking Project. Each NFT represents a specific student of the course and is uniquely created on the Polygon blockchain.

This collection was created to celebrate the community of developers who have participated in The Hacking Project and to allow them to own a part of their learning journey as a developer.

## Fonctionnality

The Hacking Project NFT Collection allows users to connect their Metamask wallet and mint their own unique NFT. Here's how it works:

Connect your Metamask wallet to our website.

Confirm the transaction on Metamask.

Once the transaction is complete, your NFT will be minted and added to your wallet.

By minting your own NFT, you can own a piece of your learning journey with The Packing Hroject and showcase your skills and accomplishments as a developer.

Please note that there may be a gas fee associated with minting an NFT on the Polygon network, which will be paid for by the user.
